# Hand-On Mathematical Optimization with Python

Welcome to this collection of repositories for the textbook "Hand-On Mathematical Optimization with Python", a project currently under development with completion expected by Fall 2024. The goals of this project is to

* provide a foundation for learning mathematical optimization,
* demonstrate the tools and concepts of optimization with practical examples,
* to help others get started with building models and solving problems using a state-of-the-art modeling language and solvers.

The main repository is a collection of [companion notebooks accessible at this link](https://mobook.github.io/MO-book/). The other repositories support the development of additional notebooks, instructional materials, supporting code, and data.

We seek your feedback! If you encounter problems or have advice on improving these examples, please open an issue using the link at the top of every page (look for the Github cat icon).
