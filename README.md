# Data-Driven Mathematical Optimization in Python

WWelcome to this collection of repositories for Data-Driven Mathematical Optimization in Python, a project currently under development with completion expected by Fall, 2022. The goals of these project are to

* provide a foundation for learning mathematical optimization,
* demonstrate the tools and concepts of optimization with practical examples,
* to help others get started with building models and solving problems using a state-of-the-art modeling language and solvers.

The main repository is collection of [companion notebookss accessible at this link](https://mobook.github.io/MO-book/). The other repositories support the development of additional notebooks, instructional materials, supporting code and data.

We seek your feedback! If you encounter problems or have advice on how to make these examples better, please open an issue using the link at the top of every page (look for the Github cat icon).
